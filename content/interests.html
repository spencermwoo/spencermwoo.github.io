						<a href = "ksdt.ucsd.edu">KSDT</a> is UCSD's very own radio station.  They give students the opportunity to record their own music, attend shows to interview artists, get free merchandise, as well as put their own radio shows or talk shows.
						<br>
						KSDT is "fiercely independent", existing to promote the unknown artist, holding to the one and only rule of not playing music that is played on other radio stations.
